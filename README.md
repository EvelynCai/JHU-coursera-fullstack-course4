# Coursera: HTML, CSS and Javascript for Web Developers
## Overview
This repository contains all of the lecture slides, sample code, assignment solutions of the Johns Hopkins University Coursera course, 
[HTML, CSS and Javascript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers).

## Coursera Link 
In this course, we learned the basic tools that every web page coder needs to know. We started from the ground up by learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. We then advanced to learning how to code our pages such that its components rearrange and resized themselves automatically based on the size of the userâ€™s screen.

Last but certainly not least, we got a thorough introduction to the most ubiquitous, popular, and incredibly powerful language of the web: Javascript. Using Javascript, we are able to build a fully functional web application that utilizes Ajax to expose server-side functionality and data to the end user.

## Customer Website Launched
As part of this course we developed a *real* website for a *real* client. Below is a link to the final product. (*Note*, the site is left without speed optimization to keep it exactly as it was in the course. Site optimization wasn't part of the course).
